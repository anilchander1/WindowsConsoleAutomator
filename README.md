# WindowsConsoleAutomator
Automate Interactive Win32 Console Programs 

#Why?
Because i did not find any portable low footprint utility to automate the windows console based programs , especially interactive programs.Python based modules like wexpect had dependencies and was not easily portable for my needs.Also such modules need python familiarity.

#How to use?
Open the project in Visual Studio 2012 or later and build.You will get <200 KB file, integrated.exe.If lazy, use the attached integrated.exe

#You need to use it by feeding a preformatted ini file. like:
integrated.exe linux.ini

Sample Ini files are attached.
